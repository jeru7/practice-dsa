Notes that I will be using on Anki.

What is Recursion?
- Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. 
- It is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

Base Case
- Every recursive solution needs to have a base case.
- This is the condition that stops the recursive calls. It's like the exit condition that prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely.

NOTE: 
Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution. A recursive solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution.
